# Wrangler GitHub Action

✨ Zero-config [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) deployment using [Wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions)

## Usage

Add `wrangler-action` to the workflow for your Workers application. The below example will publish your application on pushes to the `master` branch:

```yaml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Publish
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.0.0
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
          email: ${{ secrets.CF_EMAIL }}
```

## Configuration

You'll need to configure Wrangler using GitHub's Secrets feature - go to "Settings -> Secrets" and add your Cloudflare API key and email (for help finding these, see the [Workers documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart/#finding-your-cloudflare-api-keys)). Your API key and email are encrypted by GitHub, and the action won't print them into logs, so they should be safe!

With your API key and email set as secrets for your repository, pass them to the action in the `with` block of your workflow. Below, I've set the secret names to `CF_API_KEY` and `CF_EMAIL`:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.0.0
      with:
        apiKey: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
        email: ${{ secrets.CF_EMAIL }}
```

Optionally, you can also pass an `environment` key to the action. If you're using Wrangler's [environments](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler/blob/master/docs/content/environments.md) feature, you can customize _where_ the action deploys to by passing the matching environment in the `with` block of your workflow:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    # ... previous configuration ...
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.0.0
      with:
        # ... api key and email ...
        environment: 'production'
```

Optionally, you can also pass a `workingDirectory` key to the action. This will allow you to specify a subdirectory of the repo to run the Wrangler command from.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    # ... previous configuration ...
    steps:
      uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.0.0
      with:
        # ... api key and email ...
        workingDirectory: 'subfoldername'
```

## Use cases

### Deploying when commits are merged to master

The above workflow examples have already shown how to run `wrangler-action` when new commits are merged to the master branch. For most developers, this workflow will easily replace manual deploys and be a great first integration step with `wrangler-action`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Publish
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.0.0
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
          email: ${{ secrets.CF_EMAIL }}
```

Note that there are a number of possible events, like `push`, that can be used to trigger a workflow. For more details on the events available, check out the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on).

### Deploying on a schedule

If you'd like to deploy your Workers application on a recurring basis – for instance, every hour, or daily – the `schedule` trigger allows you to use cron syntax to define a workflow schedule. The below example will deploy at the beginning of every hour:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Publish app
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.0.0
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
          email: ${{ secrets.CF_EMAIL }}
```

If you need help defining the correct cron syntax, check out [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/), which provides a friendly user interface for validating your cron schedule.

### Deploying on a "dispatched" event

If you need to trigger a deployment at-will, you can use GitHub's API to fire a `repository_dispatch` event on your repository. By setting your workflow to trigger on that event, you'll be able to deploy your application via an API call:

```yaml
on:
  repository_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Publish app
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.0.0
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
          email: ${{ secrets.CF_EMAIL }}
```

To make the GitHub API request, you can deploy a custom [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) function, which will send a `POST` request to GitHub's API and trigger a new deploy:

```js
const headers = {
  Accept: 'application/vnd.github.everest-preview+json',
  Authorization: 'Bearer $token',
}

const body = JSON.stringify({ event_type: 'repository_dispatch' })

const url = `https://api.github.com/repos/$owner/$repo/dispatches`

const handleRequest = async evt => {
  await fetch(url, { method: 'POST', headers, body })
  return new Response('OK')
}

addEventListener('fetch', handleRequest)
```

Note that `$token` in this code sample is a GitHub "Personal Access Token". For information on how to generate this token, see the [GitHub documentation on "repository_dispatch"](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#create-a-repository-dispatch-event).

## Troubleshooting

This action is in beta, and I'm looking for folks to use it! If something goes wrong, please file an issue! That being said, there's a couple things you should know:

### "I just started using Workers/Wrangler and I don't know what this is!"

No problem! Check out the [Quick Start guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/quickstart) in our docs to get started. Once you have a Workers application, you may want to set it up to automatically deploy from GitHub whenever you change your project. That's where this action comes in - nice!

### "I'm trying to deploy my static site but it isn't working!"

To deploy static sites and frontend applications to Workers, check out the documentation for [Workers Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites).

Note that this action makes no assumptions about _how_ your project is built! **If you need to run a pre-publish step, like building your application, you need to specify a build step in your Workflow.** For instance, if I have an NPM command called `build`, my workflow TOML might resemble the following:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: Build site
        run: 'npm run build'
      - name: Publish
        uses: cloudflare/wrangler-action@1.0.0
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.CF_API_KEY }}
          email: ${{ secrets.CF_EMAIL }}
```
